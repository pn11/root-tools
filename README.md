# root-tools
Tools using ROOT libraries.

##How to install
Run `make` here to build. Binary file will created in `bin`. Add this `bin` directory in your `$PATH`.

###How to uninstall
Run `make uninstall` will remove all binary files, object files and *~ files.  `make clean` will remove all objects and  *~ files, without removing binaries.

##Programs
###hchain
Make TChain of TTree in multiple ROOT files just like `hadd`.

```
./hchain treename out.root in1.root in2.root...
```

If you have TTree named "tree" in ROOT files with name of input*.root and your output name is output.root, you will run like this:

```
./hchain tree output.root input*.root
```

If option `-f` applied, `output.root` will be overwritten.

```
./hchain -f tree output.root input*.root
```

Input file names shoud be specified with absolute path so that output file can be used in any directory.

###print_tree
Just print the branches of TTree in the ROOT file.

```
./print_tree example.root
```

###test_myColor
Check program for `myColor.h`. Under developping.

##Headers
Headers are located in `include` directory.
###myColor.h
Define custom color numbering because ROOT's default numbering sucks (How can I see number 5 (yellow)? How can I distinguish number 3 and 8?). Numbering was set Gnuplot-like.  
`int myColor(int icolor)` returns Gnuplot-like-ordered number (up to seven at present).
